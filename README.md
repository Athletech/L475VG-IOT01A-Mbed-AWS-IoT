# AWS IoT with the L475VG-IOT01A on Mbed OS
An application for the STMicroelectronics STM32L4 Discovery Kit IoT Node using ARM Mbed OS to connect to AWS IoT cloud. In parts it is inspired by the example [AWS IoT from Mbed OS device](https://os.mbed.com/users/coisme/notebook/aws-iot-from-mbed-os-device/) using the Wifi and sensor example from [Team ST](https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/). Although specifically built for the IOT01A-model, it should be compatible with the Non-US IOT01B-model.
