# AWS IoT with the L475VG-IOT01A on Mbed OS
An application for the STMicroelectronics STM32L4 Discovery Kit IoT Node using ARM Mbed OS to connect to AWS IoT cloud. In parts it is inspired by the example [AWS IoT from Mbed OS device](https://os.mbed.com/users/coisme/notebook/aws-iot-from-mbed-os-device/) using the Wifi and sensor example from [Team ST](https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/). Although specifically built for the IOT01A-model, it should be compatible with the Non-US IOT01B-model.

## Intended use of this program code
I built the program as I was unable to connect the STM32L4 to the AWS IoT cloud with any existing examples or libraries. I provide it on an AS IS basis for anyone that wants to get ahead faster with the STM32, ARM Mbed and AWS IoT. Therefore the intended user of this program should bring some basic C/C++ knowledge.
